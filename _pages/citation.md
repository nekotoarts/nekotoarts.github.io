## Licensing Information

### Articles License

**MIT** licensed. I'm more of a CC0 guy (because then I don't have to split the licenses between code and art), but the base repository for this website template was MIT licensed, so I'm just leaving it that way. MIT and CC0 are pretty compatible licenses anyways.

If you're new to code licenses, I highly recommend checking out "[Choose A License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/)", they have a pretty comprehensive and easy-to-understand review of code licenses.

### Asset Licenses

#### Nekoto's Assets ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

If there are any assets made by me posted on this website (article will specify whether I have made it), the license is **CC0** _unless otherwise specified as a different license_.

Feel free to use this information even without attribution!

#### Other Assets

Licenses will vary if the asset is from external sources, be sure to check before using them (I will usually post the license of the asset within the article). I will generally try to look for and post only CC0 / MIT licensed assets, however, sometimes that may not be possible.

## Citation Information

If you do need to cite any of the articles on this site, use the following information:
