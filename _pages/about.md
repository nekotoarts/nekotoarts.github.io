Hello there!

I'm NekotoArts, an engineering student who loves hobbyist game development.

I've been developing games since 2018 and I absolutely love doing it. Primarily, I work on VFX and shaders on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/NekotoArts) channel.

My engine of choice is the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org)

I love to share whatever knowledge and experience I have, especially on topics that I'm super passionate about such as game shaders and VFX.
