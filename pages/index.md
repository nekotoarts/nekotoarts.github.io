I absolutely love game development; I've been working on games since around 2018. Primarily, I work on VFX and shaders on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/NekotoArts) channel.

My engine of choice is the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org), but I have also used Unreal Engine and Unity for some time in the past. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILcP0TeF7fU) if you're interested in why I use Godot.

I love to share whatever knowledge and experience I have, especially on topics that I'm super passionate about such as game shaders and VFX.
