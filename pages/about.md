# About Me

I'm a mechanical engineering student who does game development as a hobby. When I started trying to implement VFX in my games, I discovered the wonderful world of shaders. I really enjoyed seeing how these beautiful combinations of computer graphics and math could be used to create grass, oceans, waving tree leaves, explosions, grass, clouds, terrain, grass, did I mention grass?

When I first started working on shaders, I struggled to find resources to learn about them, which is why I started making an effort to make shader knowledge more accessible. This website is a part of that effort.

Here's a rough overview of the languages I know and how well I know them:

If you'd like to learn more about video game shaders, please do take a look at my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@NekotoArts/featured) or my [written tutorials](/blog/), or if you'd like to see some of the stuff I've made, take a look at my [projects](/projects/)
