I was one of the main contributors to the fan-made "Bean of the Wild" project in Godot.

Our aim was to see how much of Breath of the Wild's game mechanics and VFX could be recreated within the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org).

My work on the project and development process was documented in two YouTube videos I published on my [channel](https://youtube.com/c/NekotoArts). They are linked in the [devlogs](#devlogs) section.

## Legalities

Of course, "Breath of the Wild" remains a copyrighted work from Nintendo, and the "Legend of Zelda" franchise is trademarked, which is why **_this project can never be publicly distributed or open-sourced._**

Nintendo is the original copyright holder, and therefore has the legal right to shutdown the project if open-sourced. The project cannot be open-sourced as it is not critical or commentative of the game, and cannot be protect by fair use (Stim, 2021).

The purpose of this project is **not** to modify and redistribute a fan-game of Breath of the Wild, but instead a personal, **private** learning experience for game mechanics and VFX.

Almost all assets and code from the project are my own work with the exceptions of:

-   Music
-   SFX
-   Weapon Models
