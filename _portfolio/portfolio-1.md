[Paddy](https://flamelizard.itch.io) and me decided to join a game jam hosted by [Game Endeavor](https://game-endeavor.itch.io) and [LucyLavend](https://lucylavend.itch.io) for fun. Although we totally messed up our time schedule, we were still able to create 2 levels for this game and had a lot of fun!
